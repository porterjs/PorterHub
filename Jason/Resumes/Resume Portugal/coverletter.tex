Attn. Employment Decision Committee:\\

\noindent
In the event of learning of the engineering internship in Lagos, Portugal, this summer, I felt prompted to apply for this opportunity.  Working for Battaglia Capital interests me both for the engineering task and the location.  Being a fluent Portuguese speaker and studying mechanical engineering made this an opportunity to not pass by.   \\

I am currently a senior in the Mechanical Engineering program at Brigham Young University (BYU) and work as a research assistant for the BYU Biomechanical Engineering Laboratory (BABEL).  Focus and self-mastery has enabled me to pursue learning in all areas of my life.  Through my coursework at BYU I have developed a passion for troubleshooting and problem-solving.  collaboration.  Technical Skills.  Manufacturing skills.     \\

For two years I lived in Brazil as a full-time missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  During that time I developed not only maturity and self-reliance, but communication skills required in proselytizing in a foreign language.  With consistency and diligence, I learned to speak and write Portuguese.  After returning home in 2013, I took advanced Portuguese classes and obtained my Portuguese Language Certification at Brigham Young University.\\

Your time and consideration is much appreciated and I would love to meet with you to further discuss my resume.  I look forward to hearing back from you.\\

Respectfully,\\
