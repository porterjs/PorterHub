\background{Pahoran the Older dies and leaves his three sons (Pahoran, Paanchi, and Pacumeni) to dispute over who becomes the new chief judge over the Nephites.}

\quote{4 Now these are not all the sons of Pahoran (for he had many), but these are they who did contend for the judgment-seat; therefore, \underline{they did cause three divisions among the people.}}

\date{4/5/16}
\thought{It is amazing how just three individiuals were the cause of such division.  We see this kind of division in politics all the time.  Two parties with one or two popular candidates each.  My perspective on this is that different oppinions are important.  We come to better conclusions when we debate ideas.  Even the 12 apostles of the Lord do not always agree on things, but they always are unified.  I think that is the difference between division and contrasting oppinions.}

5 Nevertheless, it came to pass that \underline{Pahoran was appointed by the voice of the people} to be chief judge and a governor over the people of Nephi.

 6 And it came to pass that \underline{Pacumeni, when he saw that he could not obtain the judgment-seat, he did unite} with the voice of the people.

 7 But behold, \underline{Paanchi, and that part of the people that were desirous that he should be their governor, was exceedingly wroth}; therefore, he was about to flatter away those people to \underline{rise up in rebellion} against their brethren.}
\thought{
Pahoran was nominated by democracy.  Paanchi accepted that he was losing and joined up with Pahoran and not his other brother Pacumeni.  Pacumeni does not accept the choice of the people and stirs up trouble.  }
