\quote{8 Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.\\
 9 Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.}
 \thought{This scripture is about you. The attitude which you choose to bear will strongly determine your progress in life.  Will you dismiss your critic with scorn like the dog that bites the hand that feeds it?  Or do you acknowledge the wisdom in others, and love them for their faults?}
